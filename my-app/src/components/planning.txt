planning everything here

we want to create the main page with about 3 columns, 6 countries, 
we can filter those specific countries in the main page design into a seperate array, to make things easier, to make things even easier, we can use an api and use query things to filter those countries
then we can also create, 4 different pages for the different filters
we can filter the african/european,asian etc... countries into different arrays


WHEN WE CLICK ON THE CARD, WE WANT TO REFRESH EVERY OTHER COUNTRY CARD AND DISPLAY THE ONE CLICKED ONLY WITH OTHER INFO

API STUFF:
-WE WANT TO FIRST GET THE MAIN PAGE OBJECTS
-THEN WE CAN GET ALL THE OBJECTS
-THEN WE CAN GET OBJECTS BASED ON THEIR REGIONS: AFRICA, ASIA, EUROPE, OCEANIA, AMERICA

TO ALLOW THE COUNTRY CARDS TO BE CHANGED WE CAN USE A SWITCH STATEMENT AND A FUNCTION, DEPENDING ON WHAT WE CLICK ON THE OPTIONS BTNS (TOP RIGHT),
WE CAN HAVE THE CARDS CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHATS CLICKED, THIS CAN ALSO BE USED TO MANIPULATE WHAT WE WILL MAP THROUGH WHEN CREATING THE DIVS
for swtich statement we can have a usestate track what btn is clicked, if the mainpage btn is clicked have that show in the switch statement and then we can have the filtered divs show up

//filter

for filter stuff, we can have the input detect change, for everythimg we type in

//WHAT TO DO WHEN WE CLICK A CARD

we will be sent to another page, we will have already captured the 'country', that was clicked and its details will be saved in a useState hook
with that we can dynamically change the page to whatever had been clicked
also we need to make another component for the back btn


CREATE ANOTHER COMPONENT FOR THE BACK BTN, THIS WILL TAKE US BACK TO THE HOME PAGE

-MAKE A COMPONENT FOR THE BORDERS WHICH WILL ALSO RETURN THE DATA OF THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE CLICKED

ANOTHER IDEA:
if the promise hasnt been sent yet, have skeletons replace the cards?? we will have 8 skeletons for when the page is loading

PSEUDOCODE:
IMPORT SKELETON FROM SKELETON COMP,
WHEN JUST RENDERED,LOADED IN, WE WANT DATA TO = 8 SO WE CAN HAVE 8 SKELETONS LAID OUT BEFORE DATA IS SET TO THE API OBJECTS


IF WE CLICK THE COUNTRY WITH THAT SPECIFIC INDEX, WE WILL FILTER DATA TILL ITS JUST THAT COCNUTRY WITH THAT INDEX AND HAVE THE SCREEN CHANGE

WE CAN MAKE AN ARRAY: [Africa, America, Europe, Asia, oceania], then map through it isnead of having it manually ( for shortening code)
