planning everything here

we want to create the main page with about 3 columns, 6 countries, 
we can filter those specific countries in the main page design into a seperate array, to make things easier, to make things even easier, we can use an api and use query things to filter those countries
then we can also create, 4 different pages for the different filters
we can filter the african/european,asian etc... countries into different arrays


WHEN WE CLICK ON THE CARD, WE WANT TO REFRESH EVERY OTHER COUNTRY CARD AND DISPLAY THE ONE CLICKED ONLY WITH OTHER INFO

API STUFF:
-WE WANT TO FIRST GET THE MAIN PAGE OBJECTS
-THEN WE CAN GET ALL THE OBJECTS
-THEN WE CAN GET OBJECTS BASED ON THEIR REGIONS: AFRICA, ASIA, EUROPE, OCEANIA, AMERICA

TO ALLOW THE COUNTRY CARDS TO BE CHANGED WE CAN USE A SWITCH STATEMENT AND A FUNCTION, DEPENDING ON WHAT WE CLICK ON THE OPTIONS BTNS (TOP RIGHT),
WE CAN HAVE THE CARDS CHANGE DEPENDING ON WHATS CLICKED, THIS CAN ALSO BE USED TO MANIPULATE WHAT WE WILL MAP THROUGH WHEN CREATING THE DIVS
for swtich statement we can have a usestate track what btn is clicked, if the mainpage btn is clicked have that show in the switch statement and then we can have the filtered divs show up

different cases for switch statement:
1) 'main-page'
2) 'Africa'
3) 'Americas'
4) 'Asia'
5) 'Oceania'
6) 'Europe'
